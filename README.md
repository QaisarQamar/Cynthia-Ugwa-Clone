# Cynthia-Ugwa-Clone
Introduction:
Hey Github community! 🌐👋 I'm excited to share with you my latest project: a website clone of the talented Cynthia Ugwa's website. 🎉 Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP, I embarked on an amazing journey to recreate the essence of her site while having my web development and design skills. 🚀

Key Features:
Before diving into the technical aspects, let me highlight some of the key features I wanted to replicate and improve upon:
Visually Stunning Design: The aesthetics of the original website were inspiring. I wanted to maintain its visual appeal while also ensuring responsiveness across various devices.
Smooth Animations: GSAP was my go-to library for creating smooth animations, and I aimed to make the user interactions on my website feel delightful.
Intuitive Navigation: One of my main objectives was to make the navigation seamless and user-friendly, allowing visitors to explore the site effortlessly.
